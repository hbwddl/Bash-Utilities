# Bash-Utilities
These are some useful bash scripts I have written to do various repetitive tasks, or notes I've taken on repetitive bash tasks I've had to look up a lot.

They are fairly simple, and necessary documentation is put in as a comment in the script.

Remember to chmod +x before you can call them in the terminal.
