Create an Alias for bash/zsh
An Alias binds a line of command line code to a shortcut you define

To define an alias, use the command

alias shortcut="command"

For example, to bind the command "ssh hbwadde@clogin01.sph.emory.edu" (which I use to log in to the cluster) to the shortcut lclust, enter

alias lclust="ssh hbwadde@clogin01.sph.emory.edu"

into your terminal program

However, this will need to be re-run every time you boot the terminal. To get around this, store your aliases in the ~/.bashrc file (OR, on a Mac terminal, the ~/.zshrc file. Look at the name of your command line program to see if it's bash or zsh) *

The ~/.bashrc file is run every time you open the terminal. Thus, this will define the aliases whenever you open the terminal.

To edit the ~/.bashrc file,

nano ~/.bashrc

Then put the alias

alias lclust="ssh hbwadde@clogin01.sph.emory.edu"

at the end of the file. **

TA DA!

Warnings:
1. Before defining the shortcut, type the shortcut into your terminal program to make sure you get the "command not found" error! Don't re-define any existing terminal commands!!!
2. Don't put spaces by the equal sign in the alias command
3. If you are on a Mac using the zsh terminal program, replace any ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc

* The meaning of the ~/.bashrc name components: ~/ points to the default home directory. The . at the beginning of the .bashrc file name indicates it's a hidden file
** You may have to sudo nano ~/.bashrc to edit the file
